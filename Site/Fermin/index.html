				<h3 class="title-small">History of San Fermin</h3>
			  	  <h2>But who was San Fermin really?</h2><br>

<p>All this celebrating is going on thanks to a saint called San Fermín. How come he has ended up being the patron saint for all this partying? 
It seems he was the son of the local head man when Pamplona was just another city belonging to the great Roman Empire back in the third century A.D.
or thereabouts. A french Bishop -San Saturnino- came down to bring the Good News to the local heathens. He did such a good job on San Fermín that
this guy decided to go up to France – to Toulouse to do some more learning and to become a bishop. Then he returned to help out with the good work that 
San Saturnino had started and then after a period he went back up to France to spread the word around the area of Amiens.
<p>
However, it seems he ran up against the local powers-to-be up there and got himself tortured and beheaded for his trouble. The body is still up there
in the local Cathedral, but some parts of it are spread round as valuable relics. Three such relics eventually made their way to Pamplona back in the middle ages and they made the guy very popular round these parts.
</p>
<p>
It's a bit ironic really that, with the curriculum that he's got, this saint should be the excuse for the annual Baccal that has become so famous round the world. He would probably turn in his grave if he only knew. But let's be fair, for many people it is something more than just "a damn good party". And so there is a pretty classy procession on his feastday – the 7th of July. And maybe he returns his thanks when he gives us that special protection during the Bull-Running when the people talk about the "capotico (the cape) of San Fermín" when there have been some lucky escapes made.
</p>
<p>
Some people take his life story with a pinch of salt. - How much is fiction? That's up to you to decide...

Pray to the Saint
</h2>
<br>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Tradition tells us that a priest named Honesto arrived in Roman Pamplona sent by Saint Saturnino to evangelize the town, and that Senator Firmo was converted to Christianity along with his family. Fermin, his son, was taught by Honesto, and when he was 17 years old, he began to preach in the surrounding area. Later, when he was 24 years old, he was confirmed as a bishop by Honorato, the prelate of Toulouse. At 31 years of age, Fermín left to preach the Gospel in Gaul: at first in Aquitaine, Auvergne and Anjou, and finally in Armens, where he succeeded in achieving a great many conversions and where he was imprisoned. On September 25, he suffered martyrdom by beheading.
</p>
<p>
His body, which was buried in secret by some Christians, was found, amazingly enough, centuries later, on January 13, 615, in the bishopric of San Salvio. It was moved to a nearby city where some magnificent Gothic reliefs from the 15th century, located in the space behind the altar of the cathedral where his remains are conserved.
</p>
<br>


<h2>Did San Fermín exist?</h2>
<p>
The apocryphal Saint. Many people will have heard tell of San Fermin, and at least recognize the name, thanks to the Fiestas that are held each year in Pamplona in his honor. However, there are few people who realize that his history, like that of many other saints, is based on legend.
</p>
<p>
According to many scholars there is no historical authenticity to be found for his life. The legend around San Fermin apparently arose around about the eleventh century in the French town of Amiens, then the capital of the region of Picardy. From there, it eventually reached the city of Pamplona about one century later, where this saint became a figure of devotion for the local population.
</p>
<p>
Just recently there has been a serious study made by the historian Roldan Jimeno, son of an equally illustrious local historian, Jimeno Jurio, which has only served to confirm the lack of any real foundation to the story of the saint. Earlier studies made in 1970 by various historians and investigators from Pamplona and Amiens had already reached the same conclusion while making independent studies on the saint. They all conclude that there is no real historical base at all to the saint. In spite of this, both in Amiens and in Pamplona, the devotion to the saint is maintained by the citizens of both towns. And of course, the name has taken on worldwide fame thanks to the annual fiestas celebrated in his name each year in Pamplona.
</p>

<h2>
The history of the San Fermín Procession
</h2><br>

<center><img src="Images/sanferminprocesinsatur.g-2.jpg"></center>

<p>
The procession was already being celebrated back in 1527 but in those times it took place in October, which is when the Sanfermin fiestas were celebrated at that time. From the Sanfermines guide, 204 hours of fiesta © Larrión y Pimoulier Editores
</p>
<p>
The procession in honor of San Fermín goes back for as long as records have existed, so it is likely that the procession is as old as the cult to the saint is, in Pamplona. Jesús Arraiza wrote in his book about the patron saint of Pamplona – "San Fermín patrono" that, although there is no written record, it is likely that the custom of having a procession began around 1187 when the bishop, Pedro de Artajona, brought the first relic of the saint from Amiens and initiated the cult of veneration of this saint in Pamplona.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, José María Corella, in his book "Sanfermines de ayer " (‘Yesterday's Sanfermines') points to the existence of graphic testimonials of doubtful origin that there was already a parade of figures which danced in the procession during the middle of the XV century. However, unlike the present-day "zaldikos" (wooden-horsed figures) which form part of the Troupe of the Giants and their entourage – The Comparsa de Gigantes y Cabezudos – the traditional flute or "gaita" was played by the dancers as they danced in their wooden horses and competed with each other to see who could make the best capers.
</p>
<p>
José María Corella also points out that the first documented reference to the procession of San Fermin dates from 1527, when the annual Sanfermin fiestas were still being celebrated on the 10th of October. At that time, the City Hall councilors were already going to the Cathedral to meet up with the Cathedral Cabildo in order to take part in the procession together and the subsequent religious acts in the church of San Lorenzo, where the saint has been worshipped since time immemorial.
</p>
<br>

<h2>
The Chapel of San Fermín
</h2><br>
<p>
The most important thing about this chapel is that it holds the figure of the saint and here it is kept throughout the year until it is taken out during Sanfermin fiestas. Sources: texts from Juan José Martinena in different publications and a conference given by José Luis Molins, city hall archivist during the cycle of talks "SAN FERMÍN: CULTO, FIESTA and ARQUITECTURA" from the University of Navarra.
</p>
<p>
San Fermín is a very special saint as both believers and non-believers in the faith approach him, to beg for protection or some similar favor when they participate in the running of the bulls. Ever since the XIV century there has been a special chapel dedicated to this saint. It was originally part of a Gothic church and small in size. During the XVI century, Pamplona city hall, the citizens themselves and people from other parts of Navarra or even from Latin-America, all contributed to the creation of a new chapel and this is the one we still use today. For that reason, the people of Pamplona and Navarra feel it belongs to them in a special way and this belief has been handed down through the generations.
</p>
<p>
The chapel of San Fermín has been constructed within the parish church of San Lorenzo, located at the very end of Main Street – the Calle mayor – in Pamplona. To enter the chapel it is first necessary to go either through the main door of the church or enter from San Francisco Street which gives access to both temples.
</p>
<p>
The chapel of San Fermín began to be constructed in 1696 and it was totally completed in 1717. On the seventh of Julio of that same year it was inaugurated. The original architect was Santiago Raón, and his Project was completed by Juan de Alegría and Martín de Zaldúa who kept the baroque style of the original plans. A curious anecdote about the chapel is the lawsuit from the XVIII century involving Pamplona city hall and the members of the church from the parish of San Lorenzo. At one point, the construction of a new temple was being seriously considered by the city hall and it was to be located in what is now the Paseo Sarasate. Plans were drawn up and these can be seen in the Municipal Archives of Pamplona although the Project itself never took off the ground. The architect who drew up the plans was Juan Lorenzo Catalán.
</p>
<p>
Something which really did take place in the chapel of San Fermín were some urgent repairs, undertaken in 1800. A man called Santos Ochandategui was put in charge of these works by Pamplona city hall and he gave a neoclassic look to the chapel which still remains today. In 1823 after a siege made by the "Cien mil hijos de San Luis" (a rebel army), the lantern of the cupola of the chapel had to be rebuilt after suffering demolition from a bombing made by the rebels.
</p>
<p>
San Fermín is stored within the chapel at the altar. The original altar was 17 meters high but this was substituted by a smaller one in 1819. The sculptures and reliefs that we can see at present are the work of Anselmo Casanova from a project by Pedro Onofre. The glasswork was made by Mayer in London.

Historia del Txupinazo

<h2>
The first one Chupinazo
</h2><br>
<p>
In 1931 a local Pamplona man called Etxepare began the custom of firing off an opening rocket to set off the fiestas. This idea was taken up again in 1939 by Joaquin Ilundain and institutionalized in 1941 in the form that we know it today.
</p>
<p>
Larrion and Pimoulier present the testimony of their friend Javier Alonso who days that he "remembers perfectly well, as well as some of his other friends, how a well-known republican and a great man from Pamplona called Etxepare was responsible for lighting the rocket in 1931, the first year of the Republic and he continued to do so until 1936 when the Civil War broke out. He was a witness of that first "txupinazo" opening rocket and he remembers that "he was dressed in the style of those days, with his dicky bow and straw hat."
</p>
<p>
This was the origin of the popular "txupinazo" opening rocket, similar to what we see today where there is a personality chosen to set off that first rocket to start the fiestas. Rockets had been fired off over many years before the 1931 initiative to announce the opening of fiestas- at least since 1901 – but in those years the employees of the fireworks firm – Oroquieta – would set off the rockets without any special symbolic value being given to the action. Etxepare first had the idea of making it a symbolic act in the republican years before the Civil war broke out in 1936 when Etxepare was then promptly executed by firing squad.
</p>
<p>
In 1939, with the ending of the Civil War, Joaquin Ilundain and Jose Maria Perez Salazar took up the tradition started by Etxepare. In 1949 Ilundain was named assistant Mayor and he continued with the tradition. He proposed to the then Mayor, Jose Garran Mosso, and his council, that the rocket should be sent off from the balcony of the City Hall. Ilundain himself was the first to set off the rocket from there and the tradition has continued uninterrupted since then.

</h2>
<br>
<p>
Sometime in the 1930s, a neighbor asked if he could light the first rocket's fuse. This simple event, little by little, gained the approval of the people of Pamplona. Sometime in the 1930s, a neighbor asked if he could light the first rocket's fuse. In 1939 Joaquin Ilundain, of Pamplona, lighted the fuse announcing Sanfermines and repeated the feat the next year as first lieutenant-mayor.
</p>
<p>
In 1941 Ilundain suggested to the Town Hall, presided then by Jose Garran Mosso, that the first rocket be shot up from a balcony of this institution, beginning in this way a custom that soon would, along with the running of the bulls, be universally representative of the fiesta of Sanfermin. This ceremony was not even suspended in 1952 when construction work on the actual Town Hall meant that the rocket had to be fired from the balcony of a temporary Town Hall, located in the Art and Music Schools in the Plaza de ]a República Argentina – today known as the Plaza del Vínculo.
</p>
<p>
Lighting the fuse, which is a matter of pride for anyone from Pamplona, has always fallen to persons linked in some way to the town government, with the exception of Manuel Fraga Iribarne, then minister of Informacion y Turismo (1964).
</p>
<br>

<h2>
From 1979
</h2><br>
<p>
The "Txupinazo" or rocket does not have a very long history compared to the rest of Sanfermin events. The mayor designates the lucky one in charge of firing the "Txupinazo". In 1979, with the first democratically elected corporation, the mayor, Julian Balduz Calvo, decided that this priviledge would go, each year, to a different political group making up the town government, beginning with the group having the largest number of representatives and continuing on down. This cycle is renewed every four years, coinciding with elections.
</p>
<p>
In 1991 Mayor Alfredo Jaime Irujo shared the fuse-lighting with Jose Maria Perez Salazar, who, together with Joaquin Ilundain (no longer alive), had suggested that the rocket should be fired from the Plaza Consistorial 50 years before.

<h2>
History of the Comparsa of Giants and Bigheads on Sanfermin"
</h2><br>

<p>
According to a rather obscure tradition, during the procession of San Fermín in 1276, three Giants, called, Peru Suziales, Mari Suziales, his wife, and one called Jusef Lukurari (" The Usurer") – a personification of the popular repulsion against the Jews at that time, – were paraded dancing through the streets.
</p>
<p>
But the first authentic references to The Giants in San Fermin date from the beginning of the XVII century; in 1607 one Joanes de Azcona is named as being responsible for bringing out the assemblage of Giants along with a minstrel who was responsible for providing the accompanying music. In 1620 it is recorded that a carpenter, Joan de Torrobas, was paid 88 "reales" to mend four Giants. It was the custom around that time to parade Giants in the evenings, after the bullfights, which were adorned with crackers and fireworks,(not unlike the present-day mechanical contrivance of the "Torch Bull" borne by a human) and which were frolicked around the square, before eventually ending up on the bonfire.
</p>
<p>
This practice of having Giants in the celebrations continued through the greater part of the XVIII century, until in 1780, The King, Carlos III, banned " the use of dancing Giants for leading any religious processions inside or outside all churches within this Kingdom" (by Royal Decree of tenth of July, 1780) which put a stop to the use of any Giants during the San Fermin celebrations. The Giants which had belonged to the Town Hall disappeared without any further trace while the Giants which belonged to the Cathedral were stored away and forgotten about, until 1813 when they were discovered by a carpenter who revived the old tradition by bringing them out once again into the streets. The response was so enthusiastic that The Town Hall gradually built up their own collection of Giants, along with accompanying figures such as the Zaldikos, Kilikis, and Cabezudos.
</p>
<p>
The Giants that are presently in use date from 1860 and were made by one Tadeo Amorena, a local painter from Pamplona. He presented a scheme to the Town Hall in March of that year to built four new Giants which would represent the "four corners of the world" and which would be more durable and yet lighter than the old ones. A local poet- one Ignacio Baleztena- couldn't help but write some caustic lines on the fact that :
</p>
<p>
"It seems poor Tadeo had never heard tell of The Oceanic Continent".
</p>
<p>
The present cabezudos in use were built in 1890 by one Félix Flores. Some of kilikis and zaldikos are from the last century while the rest date from this century.

The "Casa de Misericordia" in Pamplona
</h2>
<br>
<p>
The "Casa de Misericordia" in Pamplona exploits the Bullring in order to get Money to help run this old folk's residence for the poor and the aged. This residence has a special bullfight committee which is responsible for making contracts with the different bull-breeders to take bulls to Pamplona for the Sanfermin bullfights. It also makes contracts with the bullfighters and does all the other work in required in organizing a week of bullfights. It is also in charge of organizing the running of the bulls each morning during the fiestas
According to the bill known as the "Auto de la Ciudad" which was drawn up on the 9th of April, 1706, and which sets down the establishment of an old folk's home known as the •"Casa de Misericordia", the principal aim of the establishment was to refuge for the poor of both sexes. From 1793 up to 1980 shelter was also provided for orphan children. At present, the residence holds some five hundred and fifty old folk who are without economic resources or family or suffering from any kind of social isolation. Ever since its origins, it has also tried to provide work and training to the needy. .
</p>
<p>
These charitable aims have always needed funding and for this reason the establishment from the very beginning had sources of income such as a handkerchief factory (1706-1922), the right to exploit a pelota handball court (1777-1910) and, most importantly of all, the right to manage the annual animal fair during the fiestas of Sanfermin – the Barracas- (1882-2008). And most important of all, the Casa de Misericordia had the right to exploit the bullfighting during the Sanfermin fiestas and to this end it constructed the bullring and organized all the aspects of the bullfighting week held during Sanfermin.
</p>
<p>
It was Pamplona City Hall which ceded the ground to build the present bullring back in the early nineteen twenties of the past century. The Casa de Misericordia accepted this challenge and ever since then, as the owner of the bullring, it maintains the upkeep of the bullring and organizes the bullfights and the running of the bulls during fiestas. Even the erection of the fencing is the responsibility of the Casa de Misericordia. The Casa gets about ten percent of its total annual income from the bullfights and other events such as the running of the bulls during the fiestas.

</p>
<div>* From Barcelona to Pamplona</div><br>
<p>
When you are reserving your tickets bear in mind the kind of train bring used (Direct or regional -more stops-). The journey can be as short as four hours. The Alvia and Arco are the fastest models.

</p><br>

 

<h2>
2) To Pamplona by coach
</h2><br>
<p>
Pamplona Coach Station is located close to the center of the city in Yanguas y Miranda Street. All the coach companies arriving to or leaving Pamplona pass through this station (See routes). This coach station is quite new and state-of-the-art and is subterranean. It is linked with the train station and airport by the urban bus service. It has an automatic left luggage service but during Sanfermin fiestas it is too small to satisfy demand. Remember that there is a special left luggage service for Sanfermin located at the plaza San Francisco square which is located close by. (five – minute walk).
</p>
<br>

<h2>
3) To Pamplona by car
</h2>
<br>

<div>* Coming from Madrid</div>
<br>
<p>
Take the A-2 (main road) as far as Medinaceli: Change to the N-111 for Soria: Then take the N-122 as far as Tudela, and from there you can choose between taking either the N-121, or the motorway AP-15, straight to Pamplona. The motorway has a toll and it costs more than 11€ for the 83 klm. stretch. The whole journey from Madrid to Pamplona takes about four hours. (About 400 klms.)
</p><br>
<div>
* Coming from Barcelona:
</div><br>
<p>
The easiest route is to take the Motorway AP-2 as far as Zaragoza (Alfajarín), then the Motorway AP-68 to connection with AP-15 and then switching to the AP-15 straight to Pamplona. There is a toll and the total price from Barcelona is +36 €. If you come from Lleida it is a little bit cheaper: +25 €.
</p><br>
<div>
* If you come from Europe by car
</div><br>
<p>
The most convenient place to cross into the Spanish State is from IRUN. However, if you want to do some sightseeing along the way, there are more picturesque mountain crossings at Ibardin, Dantxarinea, Valcarlos or Eugi. Coming from IRUN the shortest and best route is the N-121 over the Belate pass. However, if you are in a big hurry, then go to San Sebastian and take the motorway A-15. This is a fast and comfortable route which takes about one hour. If you go by Belate, it takes about one and a half hours.
</p>


<h2>
4) To Pamplona by motor home
</h2>
<br>
<p>
A motor home may park just like any other vehicle in those places where it is permitted to do so as long as the volume measurements are not exceeded. However, these motor homes CANNOT BE INHABITED if they are parked within the municipal area.
</p>
<p>
You could look for different options to park in Pamplona that only exists during San Fermín. One option is to park next to the fire station, close to the Discosa gas station. Recently, has been enabled a payment parking in the school of María Ana Sanz, located in the Chantrea. You can find it on their website Parking San Fermín.
</p>
<p>
However, in the outlying neighborhood of Berriozar there is a special area designated for motor homes. (See information on the web page of Berriozar Town Hall). Berriozar lies on the outskirts of Pamplona on the north side and during Sanfermin there is an urban bus service every ten minutes which can reach the downtown area in several minutes. The designated area for motor homes in Berriozar is located in Plazaola Street, which is an easily accessible street. See map in Google maps. Coordinates (42.83827180477689,-1.6660594940185547). It has garbage facilities and electricity and running water connections. Since 2013, from the 5th to the 15th of July, Berriozar Town Hall now charges 8 euros for parking in this area. Some workers from the Berrikilan unit call round twice a day to collect the charge.
</p>


<h2>
5) To Pamplona by plane
</h2><br>
<p>
Noáin airport is situated seven kilometers outside Pamplona. On weekdays there are seven flights to and from Madrid and five to and from Barcelona. There are also flights at the weekends. It takes one hour to arrive from both cities. From these two cities you can find connections to the main airports worldwide.
</p>
<br>

<h2>
6) Pamplona by taxi
</h2>
<br>

<p>
Traveling by taxi in Sanfermin could be a sound idea as it is an especially versatile form of transport in a period when traffic flow is complicated in the city throughout the fiestas period. The taxi in Sanfermin could be a sound idea thanks to its versatility at a time when the traffic flow gets rather complicated throughout the fiestas week. It should be borne in mind that many streets in the downtown and old quarter are closed to traffic during fiestas and other streets may be temporarily cut off along the day due to fiestas events such as the running of the bulls, the kiddies firebull or even the nightly setting off of fireworks, not to mention the daily parade of the Giants and their Entourage – the Comparsa de Gigantes y Cabezudos. Taxi drivers, thanks to their professionalism, will know the quickest routes and short cuts to take in these cases and, in addition, they are sometimes allowed access to some streets which are closed to normal traffic.
</p>
<p>
To hire a taxi it is necessary to make a phone call (Teletaxi Sanfermin 948 23 23 00 / 948 35 13 35 or Ecotaxi +34 609 45 21 91), although sometimes if the green light to indicate that the taxi is free is lit you can hail down the taxi with your hand from the street sidewalk. There are also some taxi sites located around the city (Check a local city map or consult the web page of the body responsible for taxi management) – the Mancomunidad de la Comarca de Pamplona. There are different kinds of taxis in use; in large size or for cases of disabled people, etc.
</p>
<p>
Since dicember of 2004 you could take a taxi using the App of PIDETAXI. The download link by PC is this.
</p>
<p>
If your place of stay during Sanfermin is located outside the city of Pamplona, this is a list of taxi services available issued by the Navarra Government which may be of help.

<center><h1> SLEEP </h1></center>
<br>
<p>
What you sleep through is all that you haven’t lived and during the fiestas of Sanfermin you shouldn’t miss a scrap of all that is going on. However, the moment comes when sheer tiredness brings down the best of us. The possibilities of sleeping in off in Sanfermin are varied. If money is no object, a good hotel would be for you. But if you haven’t booked well in advance, forget it. Many people simply sleep it off in the parks around Pamplona. And between these two extremes there are endless possibilities of boarding-houses, private houses,, campings, etc. For sure, you will find something to suit you.
</p>

<div>

<br>
<h2>
Hotel
</h2><br>
<p>
Prices for accomodation go up for the days of the Fiesta. But if money is no big problem, the best place is always a good hotel. That’s what they are there for. The best-known ones are to be found in the old part of town.
</p>

 <p>

Hotel La Perla has long been associated with Hemingway. The Hotel Yoldi, near the old quarter, has long been associated with the bull-fighters and their entourage; the toreros used to go there. Hotel Maisonnave and the Hotel Restaurante Europa are both to be found within the old part of town. The former has an underground parking lot. The Europa also has the famous Restaurante Europa. This hotel usually organizes somekind of exhibition connected with the Fiesta during the San Fermines. The latter hotel has one of the best restaurants in the city. Nearby is the Hotel Eslava and each of these places has all the pandemonium and atmospere of the Fiesta at their doorstep. On the periferies of the old quarter you can find the Hotel Leyre (in former times called The Orhy)the Hotel Avenida (where a foreign “Peña” -The Borussia – always stay). Tres Reyes, stands out as the biggest hotel and looks onto the old quarter in all its solemn splendour. Near of the city center between Pamplona and Burlada you can find the Muga de Beloso four stars hotel.
</p>
<p>
It must be remembered that all these hotels are very close to all the action going on in the old part and if you are a light sleeper and seek some peace and quiet then it might be better to look for an hotel further out in the newer suburbs. In the area of San Juan, Ermitagaña and Iturrama you can find AC Marriot-Ciudad de Pamplona, Hotel Reino de Navarra, Hotel Sancho Ramírez, Hotel Iruña Park and Hotel Albret or Suites Mendebaldea. There are others hotels near of the city like AC Zizur Mayor, Hotel Don Carlos (Huarte-Pamplona), Hotel Restaurante Alaiz (Noáin), Hotel Andía (Orcoyen) and Hotel El Toro (Berrioplano).
</p><br>

<h2>
Boarding houses
</h2>
<br>
<p>
Boarding houses, hostels and hostales come at a cheaper Price than the classic hotels, and can be just as comfortable. There are several located around the old quarter of the city and some others in the outlying neighborhoods. Just as is the case for hotels, apartments, hostels, and indeed, all types of accommodation. Remember that you should book as early as possible. Don’t hesitate to phone for a booking ten months beforehand, it is quite normal for Sanfermin bookings. We can also inform you about distances from the downtown area (Plaza del Castillo, etc.) and how long it would take to arrive and how to get there. There is another possibity with a new service, the tourist apartments.
</p>
<p>
They are very close to the city center and well equipped for 2 and 4 people like Hemingway Hostel, Aloha Hostel, Xarma Hostel, Hostel Ciudadela and Hostal Pamplona. With more experience there are others like Hostal Navarra and Hostal Acella. All the year working Alojamiento Pamplona, Hostelet, Alojamientos Acella y Alojamientos Olga.
</p>

<br>

<h2>
Open-air
</h2><br>
<p>
If you have nowhere to sleep, or if the money is short, or if you are all spent out, you can always sleep out (From Sanfermin.com Travel tips guide) It is also quite customary to rent out apartments or rooms in Sanfermin. At our Notice-Board Sanfermin.com you can usually find people who are offering and searching for places. Sanfermin Booking (Powered by sanfermin by locals & Sanfermin.com)  offers various packets that could be of interest as they are varied and open to different kinds of travelers. You can book the balconies to the running of the bulls too.
</p>

<p>
If you just don’t sleep or just want to crash out for a few hours on the grass, remember you can do so but it is not possible to set up tents in the city parks or anywhere else that is not a proper camping site. However, you could crash out with a sleeping bag in the public parks. Pamplona is quite well served with parks, but remember that it could get cold at night (From around 14 to 22 degrees centigrade), and that it could rain. Also be aware of early morning city hall cleaners who might be hosing down the parks from early morning and give you a disruptive awakening.
</p>
<p>
If you can book hotel rooms or flights to Pamplona you can visit travel.sanfermin.com (Powered by Findor & Orbitz). If ever an issue arises you can call or email Findor team at any time (Live Chat & Voice). They’re always available and ready to help. Practically anywhere you like although most people head for one of the public parks and look for a quiet spot to crash out.
</p>















<center><h1>EAT</h1></center><br>



<p>
You can eat well or very well or practically any way you please. The prices tend to go up during these days in comparison with the rest of the year. But many places keep the same prices as the rest of the year. The real problem is simply to find a place during the Fiestas which is not overbooked.
</p>
<p>
During Sanfermin fiestas it is possible to eat just about everything. Good food is widely available and some very good food is also available. Prices tend to rise in fiestas, so you are always going to be paying a bit above the outlay of the rest of the year. But there are all kinds of levels so it is also possible to find good food without paying over the top for it.
</p>
<p>
Eating is a must to keep up energy during all the partying and bear in mind that these fiestas can turn out to be pretty much marathon sessions
</p>
<p>
We would identify six moments in the typical fiesta day when it is necessary to recharge batteries with some nourishing food: an early-morning breakfast of fritters and hot chocolate (or coffee), a mid-morning sandwich or some kind of brunch meal. A good lunch at around 2.00 p.m. or even 3.00 o’clock; a heavy snack or sandwich at the bullfights around 6.00 -7.00 o’clock; a dinner at around 10.00 or 11.00 at night and, deep into the early hours of the morning, if you are still partying, have some kind of light dinner once more, or maybe a bowl of hot consume as dawn comes up.
</p>
<div>
* A Breakfast of Fritters<br>
* Morning snacks during Sanfermin<br>
* Lunch in Pamplona<br>
* A Sandwich at the bullfights<br>
* Dinner<br>
* Early-morning Sandwich or similar<br>
</div>
<br>
<p>
It may be said that eating in Sanfermin is not a problem, but it’s a different matter to actually find a concrete place because everyone tends to want to eat at the same time and it is necessary to make reservations for many eating-houses. There are lots of options for eating in Sanfermin; there are restaurants of different category; there are bars, there are street stands; sandwich stands, special stands set up for the fiestas…etc, etc… A wide and ample offer exists, but as demand is also high, it might be advisable to spend some time checking out some places as soon as possible so that you know where you are going to go for you main meals of the day, at least.
</p>
<p>
However, differences also exist in other aspects: during the week it is more comfortable and less hectic than weekends and so waiting for a free table is less time-consuming. Weekends can be a nightmare. Patience. Also remember that Spanish eating-hours are adhered to in good restaurants. At six in the evening, it would be very difficult to eat a meal in a restaurant, but it would be possible to find a food stand on the street or at the fairground, for example. In addition to restaurants and bars there is a lot of street-stand food available, but in general, not very recommendable. If you want to try to avoid any stomach trouble, it would be more recommendable to have sandwiches or “bocatas” from any of the many bars found in the old quarter of Pamplona. These places will always guarantee better hygiene standards.
</p>

<h2>
Some practical advice about eating in Sanfermin:
</h2><br>
<p>
-Local eating times are strictly adhered to in most restaurants. That means lunches are served from between 1.30 -15.30 p.m. Dinners are served roughly between 21.00 – 23.00 p.m. That is to say, at these times you may sit at a table and eat comfortably. However, many restaurants do extend their hours during Sanfermin fiestas so it may be possible to find a table for lunch as late as five ‘clock in the afternoon and also to find late dinners being served at midnight.
</p>
<p>
–You should always go for the regular, legal and customary eating-houses that will guarantee health standards and food hygiene.
</p>
<p>
–In many places, the demand is so high that it will inevitably have repercussions on the efficiency of the service. Try to be patient and understand that it is fiesta time and there are large crowds to feed.
</p>
<p>
–Many restaurants and bars make a special effort during fiestas and they prepare special menus for Sanfermin with typical regional dishes that are worth trying.
</p>
<p>
-Check prices beforehand; prices do tend to be higher in fiestas and it’s always better to eat within your budget.
</p>
<p>
–Remember that it is not customary in Pamplona to provide some “free” tit-bits on the house when you order drink and if you see snacks and tapas on the bar counter, they are not free and perhaps not even cheap, as some of them are quite elaborate tapas which cost time and money to be made.
</p>
<p>
-Bear in mind that some establishments may open to serve lunches but do not serve dinners or tend to close at an early hour. You might not be able to have dinner in the same place that you have lunch. Check the schedules.
</p>

–Be careful of some of the temporary food stands on the street. They may not have passed any kind of hygiene inspection and they could give you an upset stomach that could ruin the fiesta fun for you.
</p>
<p>
To try to have a breakfast in one of those bars which is hosting both the night revelers on their last drinks as well as the early morning risers could be a critical decision to make as the two contrasting dispositions do not tend to harmonize. Our recommendation would be to go for a breakfast of fritters or some light repast similar to what you might have had for dinner.
</p>
<p>
The further away from the old quarter that you find yourself would probably mean that your aim of having a good hearty breakfast is more likely to be a satisfactory one. That point is well worth considering.
</p>
<br>

<h2>
A Breakfast of Fritters
</h2>
<br>
<p>
One of the most traditional breakfasts in Sanfermin has always been some hot chocolate (or coffee) with fritters. If you want to impress anyone, give them some fritters. If you want someone to fall for you, give them some fritters, if you want to meet people, give them some fritters… it’s almost like these freshly fried fritters are possessed of heavenly powers in Sanfermin. Taken with some nice hot chocolate could mean experiencing memories that will last a lifetime. It is equally well-seen to have fritters at any other time of the day and besides, they are not at all expensive fare.
</p>
<p>
There are four well-known traditional outlets for fritters in Pamplona during Sanfermin fiestas. The Mañueta Fritter shop the Lerín shop, the Gayarre fritter house and the San Miguel fritter outlet. There are also many other establishments who do fritters such as la Cafetería de El Corte Inglés,  Manterola cake shop or the vintage  Café Iruña, but we highly recommend our four favorite outlets as outlined below:
</p>
<p>

<div>The Churrería de la Mañueta</div>
<p>
Can be located in the street calle Mañueta de Pamplona. This premises is run by Paulina Fernández and her family and it is rather special as it only opens for Sanfermin and some other special dates during the rest of the year. Their traditional know-how produces some unsurpassed fritters. We suggest having a large-size taking. One piece of advice: as   Paulina en Sanfermin.com, once told us – Don’t drink water after eating hot fresh fritters.
</p>
<br>
 

<div>The Churrero de Lerín</div>

<p>
Located in  la calle Estafeta 3. Besides, making some excellent fritters, this establishment gives you the chance to dress them in a rich chocolate. On the walls here you can read messages left by people from all over the world after making a visit here. A little secret. There is always one day each year when the owner dresses up as Sanfermin and should you be by chance there on that day you will doubly enjoy the visit, both for the fritters and for the special moment with the owner in his fancy dress.
</p>
<br>
<div>
The Pastelería Gayarre (Cake shop)
</div>
<p>
It is another of the traditional establishments that sells excellent fritters in Sanfermin. Located in Olite street no. 30 it has some fritters similar to those famed one found in Madrid, large and generous sizes as well as being tasty.
</p>
<br>
<div>
Churrería San Miguel
</div>
<p>
It is located at the Antoniutti . During the rest of the year this place has a van selling at different points around the city, such as the Bosquecillo or in the main square of Plaza del Castillo. In Sanfermin they usually stay open until quite late most nights.
</p>
<br>
<h2>
Morning snacks during Sanfermin
</h2>
Brunch in Pamplona
<p>
A sandwich or some such snack at mid-morning goes down well in Fiestas. But remember that the opening day – the 6th of July, things are a little different than the rest of the fiestas days. On the 6th, before the midday Txupinazo opening rocket goes off, it is traditional to have a good heavy brunch to prepare the food for the celebrations just ahead.  Should you feel like having a good solid breakfast that morning in Pamplona, you will have difficulty in finding a  table. The local people are making reservations months ahead, or even a yearly renewal is a common thing for many people. Consequently, it is difficult to find a table in any kind of bar that particular morning in any part of Pamplona. This is a long-standing tradition for the local people and even a lot of up-market restaurants open early on that day to provide a good brunch for their clients, mostly composed of large parties of gangs of friends and colleagues.
</p>
<p>
Other days are much more accessible and a good plate of ham and eggs can be found in many bars such as  La Servicial (In Navarro Villoslada Street, 11 –close to the old quarter-), the Bar Danubio ( Santa Gemma Square- in the neighborhood of  SanJuan-), the Iruñaberri (Pío XII 7 -Iturrama-) or the Txirrintxa, located at the end of Estafeta Street.
</p>
<p>
The classic Sanfermin brunch is a mixture of a classic English fry-up and a European-style dinner.
</p>
<p>
Abundant and filling. It could not be considered a meal in itself, although in Sanfermin it might seem to be. The aim is to fill the lining of the stomach to help restore stamina, particularly after a long night’s partying or after taking part in the Running of the Bulls. It will help restore your sense of well- being, without a doubt. The basic ingredient should be a couple of “fried eggs” with… maybe with some cured ham, txistorra –type sausage, with ketchup or fried tomatoes. Drinks tend to be wine or wine mixtures such as Kalimotxo (wine with coke). However, there are many variations, depending on tastes and needs, and in some Sanfermin photos just about anything and everything has been served up for this morning brunch that would not shame the best of dinners. Let us just say it is rarely a light meal.
</p>
<br>
<h2>
Lunch in Sanfermin
</h2><br>
<p>
Eating in Sanfermin is a real pleasure. The restaurants go all out and give all their best during these days. The cooks take great pains to combine traditional dishes with a modern elaboration to create typical dishes from the region of Navarra. The fiesta atmosphere fills the dining-rooms and the staff so that as well as eating very well, you can also enjoy yourself in a festive mood just as Sanfermin fiestas should be enjoyed. It is important to make sure that you book a table beforehand. But even if you are told that everything is all booked up, keep insisting and checking out the places because there are always some people in Sanfermin who get played out well before the fiestas are over and cancel their reservations which means that there are places available even at the last moment.
</p>
<p>
The restaurants that received the best marks by clients in TripAvisor  are the following ones:  Restaurante Anttonenea, Restaurante Europa (with Pilar Idoate leading her team), Restaurante Rodero, Restaurante Alhambra,  Restaurante la cocina de Álex Mújica  Asador Olaverri (Grill bar)
</p>
<br>
<h2>
Eating at the Bullfights
</h2>
<br>
<p>
Eating at the Pamplona bullfights is a singular experience. The trick is to take along more food than you are likely to eat so that you can share it around. Because the atmosphere inside the bullring is one of harmony and sharing the fun.  At that time of the afternoon (around 7.00 p.m. /7.30 p.m.), some hours have passed since lunchtime and there is still three or four hours to go before dinner. So, most people are feeling peckish around this time, and if you are drinking, it is a good moment to put some lining in the stomach. You can come across some incredible picnic hampers in the bullring. Some people even go there with spoon in hand to sample the goods. However, if you fancy joining the repast, remember that you cannot enter with a huge knife for cutting the cured ham or with a canister of gas to mount a cooker. Inside the bullring, everything goes, so if you find yourself without a drink, it’s likely you will find some opportunities to refill inside the bullring.
</p>
<p>
In spite of the mayhem that seems to be present in the stands of the bullring, the peña clubs know very well what they are doing and they have their repasts in an orderly and methodical fashion, even saving the leftovers for another day or for the garbage containers. Indeed, it is poorly viewed – and even forbidden – to throw leftovers or drinks at other people or around the arena. It is true that in some parts of the stands there is a tradition that if they sing a happy birthday song to someone, it is usually followed by a tirade of food and drink whether it is just for the fact that after the third bull it is normal to start snacking, or maybe it really is someone’s birthday.
</p>
<p>
There are some restaurants in Pamplona that prepare some hampers for diners who have eaten in the restaurant to take to the bullring with wine or champagne included. If you are going to go to the bullfights, it is not a bad idea to take advantage of this possibility.
</p>
<br>

<h2>
Dinner in Sanfermin
</h2>
<br>
<p>
Dinner in Sanfermin consists of a huge amount of options. There are three good reasons for having a good dinner in Sanfermin: Firstly, it is a chance to pull aside from the partying, and take a pause before renewing the dancing and partying. Or maybe it is also the moment for some to start the night, before watching the fireworks with the family or whoever, Also it could be the first step before heading off to the fairground or some of the different music concerts such as those at the Antoniutti. Another interesting option is to have a dinner of tapas at the Baluarte hall and watch the fireworks from the terraces there. the view from the terrace of the Baluarte is incredible and this is an reservation option which can be booked for 85 euros at Sanfermin.com in collaboration with the firm Destino Navarra
</p>
<p>
Having dinner at the fairground, at Antoniutti near the concert stage, or in some of the regional stands set up for the fiestas, means having the typical food that you find at fairs and fairgrounds. These establishments are very traditional in Sanfermin, with staff who have a lot of experience and who make their living from this rather nomadic lifestyle which means they usually make a big effort to please the customers. The seating and tables are not as comfortable as you would find in most restaurants, but they have the advantage of being right at the heart of the fiestas scene, so that makes them popular for many families and visitors. The regional eating-houses usually have some kind of concert going on in the middle of the area where they are located, as happens at the Antoniutti (sometimes the Big Wheel is located here) or at the fairground (Fairground Park).
</p>
<p>
It is important to keep an eye on the clock when deciding to have dinner, as some establishments can quickly turn from being eating-places into being dance –halls in a few short minutes. In fact, even if they are still serving up some food, the partying does not come to a stop in these places. Another option is to just have a “tapas” dinner, perhaps in Estafeta Street. You would also find plenty of places there selling sandwiches of different kinds. One of the advantages of having sandwiches is that you can take them with you just about anywhere, without losing out on the quality. We can recommend good quality sandwiches at places like the  Bar Casa Jesus Mari, La Botería in Roncesvalles Street, near the bullring. (It’s well worth trying their sandwich of pork slices with comfit of duck and Roquefort cheese- real yummy- and there is also a wide range of sandwiches from the kitchen of Álex Mújica (located in Estafeta Street).
</p>
<br>

<h2>
“Second” dinners or “Recenar” in Sanfermin
</h2><br>
<p>
What does that expression mean? Well, according to the dictionary of Real Academia de la Lengua Española “recenar” means to having a second dinner when a lot of time has passed between one’s first dinner and one’s bedtime. Well, yes, that makes sense in fiestas when you find yourself still up and about, hours after having dinner and yet it is still a bit early for breakfasts to be served. The problem is that at those hours many establishments have their kitchens closed and cannot fill the demand. This is the moment when the illegal food stands come into their own.
</p>
<p>
While showing all the respect we can to all those who are trying to make a living, it should be borne in mind that these places do not undergo any kind of hygiene inspections that the legal food establishments must undergo. This could result in catching a dose of gastroenteritis that could upset your fiesta fun. Better to be safe than sorry, and we would recommend a consommé soup or sandwich at one of the many bars which serve these items throughout the night. And then in the morning light you could try the first item recommended by us at the top of the page – A Breakfast of Churros (Fritters)
</p>

<br><br>



<center><h1>DRINK</h1></center><br>


<p>
Pamplona is a town with quite a large number of bars, in Sanfermin all the atmosphere is very similar in all the places
</p>
<p>
Pamplona is a city with a large number of bars but a large number of visitors also come for fiestas and that means a lot of overcrowding in many places. Terraces can be useful in these circumstances and there are also some other means to ensure a good service is found, which we outline below.
</p>
<p>
Drinking is an extended habit during Sanfermin fiestas, but it is also possible to have a great time in fiestas without touching a drop of alcohol as many people also continually demonstrate. There has always been a tradition of drinking hard to keep spirits up in fiestas, but we would also recommend moderation in alcohol consumption so as not to ruin the fun for yourself and indeed, for others.
</p>
<p>
Drinking in Pamplona consists of two different characteristics: drinking in bars and drinking in the street. The streets of the old quarter of Pamplona and surrounding areas are lined with bars. This is where most of the partying is going on during fiestas. However, these bars are also small and narrow, in general. They become even smaller with the crowds who gather for the fiestas. For that reason, there are two principal inconveniences about drinking in the bars: trying to get your order in and then drinking it on the premises squeezed in among so many people. Thus, many people are forced out to the street with their drinks in hand. There is a bye-law against taking drinks out to the street after 23.00 p.m. but, inevitably, it is difficult to enforce during fiestas and a blind eye is turned unless there is some special reason to enforce the law.
</p>
<br>
<h2>
Some advice about drinking:
</h2>
<br>
<p>
-When the bars are crowded, some bars are conditioned to open to side window and serve customers directly from the street. Among these bars, the El Txoko, El Okapi, the Cervecería de la Estafeta and the Roncesvalles.
</p>
<p>
–Take advantage of the terrace seating provided by many bars. You can get waiter service and still do you own thing without suffering the heat and congestion of the interiors. Perhaps the best area for this is the Bajada del Labrit zone, where there are some enormous terraces with special stands to serve drinks where you can dance day and night. Similar terrace bars may be found in the streets of calle Olite and the calle Roncesvalles. There are also several such large terrace areas to be found in the main square of La Plaza del Castillo, although these tend to have a more solemn atmosphere and less apt for dancing than the other recommended spots mentioned.
</p>
<p>
–You can also head straight for some of the largest bars, which although few in number, have a good scene going, such as the Café Iruña and the Casino Eslava (two floors), located in the heart of the main square of the Plaza del Castillo.
</p>
<p>
-In all the places where there are music shows going on, there are drinks stands available. There is no need to carry drink or glasses around just because you think there will not be any service at the open-air shows. Just about anywhere you can dance, you can also drink.
</p>
<p>
–Remember that there are garbage containers for glass and other ones for plastics, etc. To be found all over the town. There are also some special red litter boxes set up in the old quarter where you can leave your used material.
</p>

<p>
Carrying drink around on the streets, the so-called –beber ambulante – is a traditional habit in Sanfermin and that is the explanation for the long-standing traditional use of botas de vino – the leather-bags filled with wine, which were once so popular, but nowadays are rarely used, except perhaps at the bullring. Currently, during fiestas, many imaginative forms of carrying around drinks can be found. Supermarket trolleys, empty fuel containers filled with drink, drums, helmets holding beer cans, water flasks for sports but now filled with wine, etc, etc.

                Bull Run
              </h3>
             <center>
<br>
<img src="Images/1981.jpg">
</center>
<h1>Bull Runs</h1>
<p>
The Running of the Bulls is a practice that involves running in front of a small group of cattle, typically six, of the toro bravo breed that have been let loose on a course of a sectioned-off subset of a town's streets.
</p>
<p>
The most famous running of the bulls is the eight-day festival of Sanfermines in honour of Saint Fermin in Pamplona, although they are also traditionally held in other places such as towns and villages across Spain, Portugal, in some cities in Mexico and southern France during the summer.
</p>
<p>
The origin of this event comes from the need to transport the bulls from the fields outside the city, where they were bred, to the bullring, where they would be killed in the evening. During this 'run', youngsters would jump among them to show off their bravado. In Pamplona and other places, the six bulls in the event are still those that will feature in the afternoon bullfight of the same day.
</p>
<p>
Spanish tradition says the true origin of the run began in northeastern Spain during the early 14th century. While transporting cattle in order to sell them at the market, men would try to speed the process by hurrying their cattle using tactics of fear and excitement. After years of this practice, the transportation and hurrying began to turn into a competition, as young adults would attempt to race in front of the bulls and make it safely to their pens without being overtaken. When the popularity of this practice increased and was noticed more and more by the expanding population of Spanish cities, a tradition was created and stands to this day.
</p>
<br>

<h2>Pamplona Bull run</h2>

<p>
The Pamplona encierro is the most popular in Spain and has been broadcast live by RTVE, the public Spanish national television channel, for over 30 years. It is the highest profile event of the San Fermin festival, which is held every year from 6 - 14 July. The first bull running is on 7 July, followed by one on each of the following mornings of the festival, beginning every day at 8 am. Among the rules to take part in the event are that participants must be at least 18 years old, run in the same direction as the bulls, not incite the bulls, and not be under the influence of alcohol.
<p>
<br>

<h2>Fence</h2>
<br>
<center><img src="Images/150707-bulls1.jpg"></center>
<p>
In Pamplona a set of wooden fences is erected to direct the bulls along the route and to block off side streets. A double wooden fence is used in those houses where there is enough space for it, while in other parts the buildings of the street act as barriers. The gaps in the barricades are wide enough for a human to slip through, but narrow enough to block a bull. The fence is composed of around three thousand separate pieces and while some parts are left for the duration of the fiesta others are mounted and dismounted every morning. Spectators can only stand behind the second fence, whereas the space between the two fences is reserved for security and medical personnel and also to participants who need cover during the event.
</p>
<br>

<h2>Before Bull Run </h2>

<p>
The encierro begins with runners singing a benediction. It is sung three times, each time being sung both in Spanish and Basque. The benediction is a prayer given at a statue of Saint Fermin, patron of the festival and the city, to ask the saint's protection and can be translated into English as "We ask Saint Fermin, as our Patron, to guide us through the encierro and give us his blessing". The singers finish by shouting "Viva San Fermin!, Gora San Fermin!" ("Long live Saint Fermin", in Spanish and Basque). Most runners dress in the traditional clothing of the festival which consists of a white shirt and trousers with a red waistband ("faja") and neckerchief ("panuelo"). Also some of them hold the day's newspaper rolled to draw the bulls' attention from them if necessary.
</p><br>

<h2>The Running </h2>

<p>
A first rocket is set off at 8 a.m. to alert the runners that the corral gate is open. A second rocket signals that all six bulls have been released. The third and fourth rockets are signals that all of the herd has entered the bullring and its corral respectively, marking the end of the event. The average duration between the first rocket and the end of the encierro is two minutes, 30 seconds.
</p>
<p>
The encierro is usually composed of the six bulls to be fought in the afternoon, six steers that run in herd with the bulls, and three more steers that follow the herd to encourage any reluctant bulls to continue along the route. The function of the steers, who run the route daily, is to guide the bulls to the bullring. The average speed of the herd is 24 km/h (15 mph).
</p>
<p>
The length of the run is 875 meters (957 yards). It goes through four streets of the old part of the city (Santo Domingo, Ayuntamiento, Mercaderes and Estafeta) via the Town Hall Square and the short section "Telefonica" (so named for the mobile phone operator located at the intersection) just before entering into the bullring through its callejon (tunnel). The fastest part of the route is up Santo Domingo and across the Town Hall Square, but the bulls often became separated at the entrance to Estafeta Street as they slowed down. One or more would slip going into the turn at Estafeta ("la curva"), resulting in the installation of anti-slip surfacing, and now most of the bulls negotiate the turn onto Estafeta and are often ahead of the steers. This has resulted in a quicker run. Runners are not permitted in the first 50 meters of the encierro, which is an uphill grade where the bulls are much faster.
</p><br>

<h2>Dress Code</h2>
<center><img src="Images/EKP_0185-681x1024.jpg"><img src="Images/san-fermin.jpg"></center>
<p>
Though there is no formal dress code, the very common and traditional attire is white pants, white shirt with a red scarf around the waist and a red handkerchief around the neck. The majority of runners are similarly dressed, many times with red wine stains from the previous night or earlier in the festival.
